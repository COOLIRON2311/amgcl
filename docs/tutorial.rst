Tutorial
========

In this section we will solve some systems from the `SuiteSparse Matrix
Collection`_.  The collection is a widely used set of sparse matrix benchmarks
collected from a wide range of applications. The solution timings used in the
sections below were obtained on an Intel Core i5-3570K CPU. The timings for the
GPU backends were obtained with the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU.
