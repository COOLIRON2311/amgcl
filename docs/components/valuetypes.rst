Value Types
===========

A value type enables transparent solution of complex or non-scalar systems.
Most often, a value type is simply a ``double``, but it is possible to use
small statically-sized matrices as value type, which may increase
cache-locality, or convergence ratio, or both, when the system matrix has a
block structure.
