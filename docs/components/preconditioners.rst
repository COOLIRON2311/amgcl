Preconditioners
===============

Aside from the AMG, AMGCL implements preconditioners for some common problem
types. For example, there is a Schur complement pressure correction
preconditioner for Navie-Stokes type problems, or CPR preconditioner for
reservoir simulations. Also, it is possible to use single level relaxation
method as a preconditioner.
